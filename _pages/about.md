I am a researcher with a passion for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine. I am pushing forward Surgical AI research to "make surgery intelligent".
From April 2024 on, I am associate professor for Digital and Robotic Surgery at [Universitätsmedizin Göttingen](https://chirurgie.umg.eu) where I am leading the [Center for Digital Surgery](https://chirurgie.umg.eu/center-for-digital-surgery/).
My research evolves around multi-modal AI, personalized medicine, continual machine learning, biomedical image and signal analysis as well as medical robotics.

Besides that, I am a huge tea enthusiast, so if you are in for a good cup (mostly green, white, oolong or pu erh tea), please do reach out!

Before that, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at [Fraunhofer IMTE](https://www.imte.fraunhofer.de) and at the University of Oxford in the [Computational Health Informatics](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/chi/) Lab of Prof. David Clifton.  
I pursued a my doctoral degree under the supervision of Prof. Floris Ernst at the University of Lübeck in the [Institute for Robotics and Cognitive Systems](https://www.rob.uni-luebeck.de/index.php?id=267). My thesis was awarded the "Fokusfinder Preis 2022" from the [Initiative Bildverarbeitung e.V.](https://www.initiative-bildverarbeitung.de/home/). I hold a Master of Science and a Bachelor of Science in Medical Engineering Science, both from the University of Lübeck, with a strong focus on applied mathematics and computer science. During my studies, I was intern at the [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn) and at [Dräger](https://www.draeger.com/).

I am a member of the board of the [Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Foundation (MIDL)](https://www.midl.io) and served in the organization committees of several MIDL events (Chair at [MIDL Winter Workshop 2021](https://www.midl.io/winter-workshop.html), Chair at [MIDL Doctoral Symposium 2021](https://2021.midl.io/doctoral-symposium.html), Social Chair and Virtual Arrangement Organizer at [MIDL 2021](https://2021.midl.io)). I am reviewing regularly for journals (e.g. Medical Image Analysis, The Lancet Digital Health, IJCARS, ...) and conferences (e.g. MIDL, IEEE BHI, BMT, CURAC, ...).

Besides my research, I am eager to share my expertise with open minds of all ages. Therefore, I taught Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at the University of Oxford, the University of Lübeck and the University of Applied Sciences Vienna (Fachhochschule Wien der WKW, organized via the [AIHE](https://academic-institute.com/en/)). Apart from academic teaching, I am author of several online courses on Machine Learning for practitioners from industry and held workshops on Artificial Intelligence for non-technical audience.
