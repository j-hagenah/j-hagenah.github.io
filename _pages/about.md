I am a researcher in Artificial Intelligence in Medicine with strong interests in Medical Image and Signal Analysis, Medical Robotics, Personalized Medicine and Healthcare in Ressource-Constrained Settings. Currently, I am a postdoctral researcher at the University of Oxford in the [Computational Health Informatics](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/chi/) Lab of Prof. David Clifton. 

Before that, I worked at the University of Lübeck in the [Institute for Robotics and Cognitive Systems](https://www.rob.uni-luebeck.de/index.php?id=267) where I pursued my doctoral degree under the supervision of Prof. Floris Ernst. I hold a Master of Science and a Bachelor of Science in Medical Engineering Science, both from the University of Lübeck, with a strong focus on applied mathematics and computer science. During my studies, I was intern at the [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn) and at [Dräger](https://www.draeger.com/).

I am a member of the young researchers board of the [Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Foundation (MIDL)](https://www.midl.io) and served in the organization committees of several MIDL events (Chair at [MIDL Winter Workshop 2021](https://www.midl.io/winter-workshop.html), Chair at [MIDL Doctoral Symposium 2021](https://2021.midl.io/doctoral-symposium.html), Social Chair and Virtual Arrangement Organizer at [MIDL 2021](https://2021.midl.io)). I am reviewing regularly for journals (e.g. Medical Image Analysis, The Lancet Digital Health, IJCARS, ...) and conferences (e.g. MIDL, IEEE BHI, BMT, CURAC, ...).

Besides my research, I am eager to share my expertise with open minds of all ages. Therefore, I taught Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at the University of Oxford, the University of Lübeck and the University of Applied Sciences Vienna (Fachhochschule Wien der WKW, organized via the [AIHE](https://academic-institute.com/en/)). Apart from academic teaching, I am author of several online courses on Machine Learning for practitioners from industry and held workshops on Artificial Intelligence for non-technical audience.
